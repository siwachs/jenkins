The leading open source automation server, Jenkins provides hundreds of plugins to support building, deploying and automating any project.
ie it is a automation platform aloow to build, test and deploy software using pipelines.

It can be use to automate any tasks like run Bash and Python scripts. It provide a web GUI where we can create tasks for manage source control, build triggers etc.



Jenkins Infrastructure
We have master server which control Pipelines, Schedules Builds to Agents

And then we Agents that perform build in their workspace.

Example:
1) Push a commit to GitHub
2) Jenkins master aware of this commit and trigger approprite pipeline
3) And distributes the build to one of Agent to Run. It select Agent based on Configured Labels

Agent Types
1) Permanent Agent
Dedicated Servers for Running Jobs (Nedd Java and SSH connection as Master server make connections over SSH)

2) Cloud Agents
Ephemeral/Dynamic Agents spin up on demand
Example: Docker, Kubernetes and AWS fleet manager



Build Types
1) Freestyle Build
Simplest method to create a build
Feels like Shell Scripting that run on a server triggered b specefic events (like commit on GitHub)

2) Pipelines
Use Jenkins files written Groovy Syntax to specif what happens during the build
Use stages (Ex: Clone, Build, Test, Package, Deploy) to break down components of build

ie Jenkins is tool to automate work, tasks or deployment.
